# Facebook Event Filter

Filters and sanitizes your Facebook events into ical [eventcal.flown.io](https://eventcal.flown.io)

Facebook provides a way to export and sync all your events to a third party calendar application such as Google Calendar, Apple Calendar or Outlook. However they include events not yet responded to. This service can declutter your calendar by filtering out those events.
